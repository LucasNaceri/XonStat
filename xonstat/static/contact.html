<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>
  This site uses session cookies to store user interface preferences while the browser windows is open.
  <br/>The use of this kind of cookies does not require consent (see <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2012/wp194_en.pdf">Chapter 3.6</a>).
</p>

<h3>Privacy</h3>
<p>
  qlstats.net is operated by a private person residing in Austria, so the Austrian <a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&Gesetzesnummer=10001597">Datenschutzgesetz 2000</a> (data privacy law) is applicable.
  <br />The relevant parts of the the DSG 2000, which implements EU Directive 95/46/EG in national Austrian law, are:
  <br />§ 4 Z 1, § 8 Abs. 2, § 12 Abs. 3 Z 2, § 17 Abs. 2 Z 3, § 29
  <br/>Note that the law makes explicit distinctions between directly and indirectly identifiable data.
  <br/>
  <br/>I do NOT store any information which could be used to directly identify a person (e.g.: name, home address, email address, ip-address, ...)
  <br/>The stored information is tied to a steam-id, which only indirectly identifies a person and cannot be used to retrieve a person's identity, neither by qlstats.net nor a 3rd party receiving data from qlstats.net.
</p>

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>
  qlstats.net is not responsible for user generated content (i.e. a users nicknames) nor for content on linked external sites (i.e. steam profiles).
  If unlawful or offending content is found and/or reported to qlstats, it will be removed as soon as possible.
